			<p>Design by Nature offers creativity and vision in its approach to contemporary and sustainable developments based on the principles of biophilic design. We believe that inspired innovation and whole systems thinking brings healthy and rewarding solutions.</p>
			<p>Biophilic design is an approach which asserts <code>Assert is too forceful</code> that humans have an innate connection with nature that can assist to make buildings and cities more effective human abodes. The principles can be applied at any scale from office, home, building, precinct to citywide: retrofitted or new, and brings multiple social, environmental and economic benefits.</p>

								<p>Contemporary cities have high stress levels, mental health issues, high crime levels and ill health, while our built urban environment struggles to cope with increasing problems from urban heat island effects and air and water pollution. Emerging from these concerns is a new champion where nature is the hero: biophilic urban design. This design approach asserts that humans have an innate connection with nature that can assist to make our modern cities more effective human abodes. This paper examines the evidence for this innate human psychological link to nature and then assesses the emerging research supporting the multiple social, environmental and economic benefits of biophilic urban design.</p>

								<p>Increasing nature and natural elements within a prison offers the potential to de-stress residents, improve mental health, cognitive functioning and learning, reduce recidivism and increase receptivity for behavioural change and restorative justice opportunities. Biophilic design is outlined as a set of principles and practices for cities to bring nature into urbanites’ daily life. The role of nature in restorative initiatives is traced back to the early work of innovative psychoanalyst Eric Fromm showing how his framework of human psychological pathways overlaps with biophilic design principles. Together, these approaches should provide new ways to improve the prison experience. </p>

								<p>Cities are experiencing rapid population growth and an urban transformation to post-industrial knowledge-based economies. Within this transition is a proposed redefining of urbanites’ relationship with nature which suggests that significant human nature interaction should occur within cities, not just outside. Biophilic design has emerged as a social movement which suggests there is an innate human need to affiliate with nature within the built environment. The thesis begins by examining the evidence for this innate human need and how this flows into socio-psychological and environmental benefits. These are likely to lead to economic benefits.</p>
								<p>In order to understand biophilic design as a social movement an immersive journey of heuristic inquiry was undertaken. The thesis concludes that biophilic urban design is a social movement moving quickly into the mainstream phase. A ten step framework is developed for assisting in the mainstreaming of the social movement of biophilic design based on the conclusions of the heuristic inquiry.</p>
								<p>Connecting urbanites to nature through biophilic design appears to encourage a desire for more. The biophilic design social movement journey, if enabled, could ripple through and transform our sterile urban landscapes into urban nature habitats.</p>

								<p>Scientific monitoring involved data loggers collecting temperature and humidity plus water usage and plant growth. A social survey was undertaken with the use of a QR code link on the signage. The aim was to gain an indication of public response to building integrated vegetation in the urban environment. The green walls have thrived and the public response was positive overall. The walls are continuing as an ongoing feature.</p>
